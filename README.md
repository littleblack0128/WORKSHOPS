## Introduction
Unemployment has always been a hot issue in the United States, and it is a big concern for international students. As graduate students who expect to land a job or internship after graduation, we decide to look at the huge issue from a student’s sight. In addition, the aspects which students are interested when facing career decisions will be examined. We made several assumptions about what might affect unemployment rate among namely poverty rate, household income, or education level. We dig deep into the influencing factors and see their impacts to unemployment rate as well as the correlation between them.


Our analysis is based on a stable and comprehensive database originally from Department of Agriculture, Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics.The data of Poverty Estimates (2015), Education (1970-2015), Unemployment (2007-2016) and Population Estimates (2010-2016) were used in our analysis. It contains detailed data of the unemployment to county level of year 2015. It also contains median household income for the year 2015. So we can make comparison between unemployment and household income. Education related data is also included in the set which also be the factor we can create bond to unemployment.

## Process
We firstly looked into the overall status of the employment in US and provided the trend of how unemployment rate altered from the last 10 years. We also saw the figures from a regional level, mapping the severity of unemployment among the country.


To better consider the reason behind the change and the distribution, we then did research on the background of population distribution of the country to see if there was relation with employment trend.The population showed a stable upward trend, and the immigration number had a huge jump at 2011 which may be related to the beginning of dipping trend of unemployment.

We then digged deeper into the influencing factors, we did a graph about numbers of people with different levels of education background since 1970. From a graph, we saw a trend that numbers of people who had higher education level increase over time. After this, we found there was a positive relationship between numbers of people with high degree education level and numbers of employment in different states.

To identify whether there were correlations of these impact factors, we also did the scatter plot, where can be  found that Employment  has some correlation with immigration,population, education level. 

## Challenges and Solutions
During our exploring to the data,we have encounter the following challenges. We faced data issues like null values. In order to not affect the trend and result, we came up with two solutions. One was ignoring the null values and the other alternative was creating filters to filter out the null values. In addition, while we were trying to visualize the data such as developing a map with states level, we found the lack of latitude and longitude. We found other problems like we could not calculate specific county, needed more information and variables from other data sets, and tried to built time series model to forecast the unemployment rate, but did not have date variable.
 
 
Not only did we found challenges, but also encountered challenges by complementing analysis methods. For example, for how to find the correlation between unemployment rate and other variables, we used relevant analysis to show the relationships between unemployment rate and other variables.
